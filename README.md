# Titanic_Passenger_Survival_Prediction
This predicts and analyzes Titanic passenger survival rate with random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression.  
The workflow of this data mining project inludes:
- Preliminary analysis with R, including Apriori algorithm, correlation analysis and data visualization(using ggplot2)
-	Data preprocessing and feature engineering with python
-	Random Forest modeling with python (to get an out-of-bag error of 0.162)
- Decision Tree modeling with R to get the "survival tree"
- Logistic Regression modeling with R to explore factors influencing the survival rate (Feature importance ranking by Random Forest is used as a feature selecting tool to choose important features for Logistic Regression)
